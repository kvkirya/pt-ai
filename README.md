PT.AI is a project made to help people with their homeworkouts. 
As you train at home you can record a video of you doing the exercise and upload it to PT.AI which will then evaluate your form and tell you whether you're doing it correctly or not.
PT.AI is trained on the InfiniteForm Dataset linked: https://pixelate.ai/InfiniteForm

The project was created by 4 people being: alexandergreen550, EmmaAHV, nicolaynicolavich and kvkirya
